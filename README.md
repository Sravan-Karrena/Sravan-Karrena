Sravan Kumar Karrena

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sravan Karrena.

I've got a background in Electronics & Communication Engineering and I'm currently getting my MBA in Business Analytics at Utica University. That means I like both the tech side of things *and* the business/data side.

I'm all about finding ways to use technology and data to make things better. Whether it's building a system that recognizes faces or figuring out how to make traffic flow more smoothly, I'm excited to create solutions.

What I Can Do

Here are some of the things I'm good at:

Data Stuff: I can use tools like Excel, Alteryx, and Tableau to analyze data and find patterns. 

Coding: I know a few programming languages like C, C++, and Java. 

RF Stuff: I've worked with tools for radio frequency stuff, like TEMS and Azenqos. 

What I've Done

Here's a quick look at my experience:

Financial Analyst (Part-Time): At Dhruv Hospitality, I checked financial stuff to make sure it was correct. 

5G Network Operator: I helped set up 5G networks for Jio. That involved coordinating teams and keeping track of everything. 

4G RF Engineer: I worked on 4G networks for Airtel, making sure the signals were strong and fixing any problems. 

My Projects

Want to see some of the things I've built?

Robust Face Recognition: I created a system that can recognize faces, even if they're not perfectly clear. 

Traffic Control System: I designed a smart system for traffic lights that uses sensors to change the lights. 

I also helped write a research paper about how to recognize human faces.
